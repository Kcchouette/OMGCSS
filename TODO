+ Add a scroll-to-top button, eventually with JS to display it only when scrolled down. Better have it in pure css3
+ Add a component like a vertical list of links and a correspondant page and when you scroll in the page, the style of the active link you're currently reading is changed. (will probably use js too)
+ Add a popup system for messages or forms in popup
+ Improve grid system, go from 4 to 6 columns or maybe 8 (but not 12 !)
